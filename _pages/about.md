# 👋 About Me

I am Wenxia Wang (王文霞), a PhD candidate in Nursing at the School of Nursing, Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Zhiwen Wang. My research focuses on leveraging technology to improve elderly care and healthcare outcomes.

My research interests include:
- **Affective Computering**: Utilizing multimodal data to recognize and respond to emotional states of the elderly
- **Intelligent Healthcare Systems**: Development of intelligent recommendation systems for the care of older adults with dementia
- **Chronic Disease Prevention**: Prevention and intervention models for chronic diseases in elderly populations

I have published several papers in high-impact nursing and medical journals, including *Journal of Clinical Nursing* (Q1), *Journal of Medical Internet Research* (Q1), and *International Journal of Nursing Studies* (Q1).
